## Coding Raja Technologies Data Science Internship

This repository contains the projects completed during my Data Science Internship at Coding Raja Technologies. The projects demonstrate various machine learning and data analysis techniques applied to real-world problems. Below are the details of each project included in this repository.

### 1. Fraud Detection

**Project Description:**
The Fraud Detection project is designed to identify fraudulent activities in financial transactions using machine learning techniques. This notebook provides an end-to-end solution for detecting fraud by preprocessing data, training a machine learning model, and evaluating its performance.

**Key Features:**
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Feature Importance Analysis

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

**Usage Instructions:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
4. Use the trained model to make predictions on new transaction data.

### 2. Movie Recommendations

**Project Description:**
The Movie Recommendations project aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and viewing history. This notebook explores various recommendation algorithms, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches.

**Key Features:**
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Implementation of Recommendation Algorithms
- Model Evaluation
- User Interface for Recommendations

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Surprise
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

**Usage Instructions:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to preprocess data, implement recommendation algorithms, and evaluate their performance.
4. Use the recommendation system to suggest movies to users based on their preferences.
